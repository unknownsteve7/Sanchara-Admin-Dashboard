## The problem
Manual household travel surveys are slow, costly, and cover a tiny share of the population. NATPAC needs accurate, continuous trip data—trip number, origin, time, mode, destination— to establish activity chains and plan better.

## Analytics Page 
A privacy-first travel data app powering NATPAC with rich analytics: automatic and manual trip capture syncs to dashboards that map OD flows, detect travel chains, and segment by mode, time, and cohort. Real-time KPIs track distance, duration, peak hours, and corridor loads, while trend, anomaly, and equity views guide policy and network design. Admins export CSV, JSON, and API feeds for modeling.
